# Funding-Recommendation
A funding recommendation project based on Markowitz and Black-Litterman model.

This is my first practical project during my internship at Asset Pro in Beijing. And the project will also be implemented in the "Navigator" financial APP that the company is developing currently.

I first obtained the historical NAV data for 790 selected funds from Bloomberg based on Python, Excel and R.

Then I designed a questionaire for investigating the customers' specific needs (like risks and return rates requirements).

And then I designed the specific funding recommendation system to satisfy each customer's specific needs based on Python and R. I utilized the famous Markowitz and Black-Litterman model in the main body of the project.
