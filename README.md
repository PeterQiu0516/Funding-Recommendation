# RoboAdvisor - A Portfolio Selection Recommendation System
A portfolio selection recommendation system based on Markowitz Mean-Variance Model and Black-Litterman Model implemented on the App `Navigator`.

This is my first practical project during my internship as a data analyst at a leading fintech company in Beijing. And the project is already implemented on the `Navigator` financial APP with thousands of users.

You may also take a glance at the sample portfolio report generated by the Roboadvisor.

### Programming Languages

>+ **Python 3**: For model implementation `(PyPortfolioOpt)`, fund prediction `(statsmodels)`, online data crawling `(selenium)`, project integrating `(rpy2)` and data processing `(pandas)`.
>+ **R**: For model implementation `(PortfolioAnalytics)` and online data crawling `(rvest)`.
>+ **Javascript**: For plotting related intuitive financial figures `(ECharts)` and online survey designing.
>+ **Html**: For online survey designing.

### Building
Download the whole repository through [this link](https://github.com/PeterQiu0516/RoboAdvisor/archive/master.zip).


### Running
Access the `Final Version` directory and make sure that the three input files `bloomberg.csv`„ÄÅ`filter.csv` and `newfund.csv` are present in the `Final Version` directory.

All functions are included in the `app.py` file.

Implementation and running are included in the `Navigator` App for commercial purpose, so detailed running process will not be made public.

You may also refer to the sample report to get a quick glance at the output generated by RoboAdvisor.

## Milestones

### Data Acquisition - Web Crawler
Our team first crawled the historical data for 800 selected funds from [iFund](https://www.ifund.com.hk/en/companies/) and Bloomberg terminal.

For more details, you may refer to my [Web Crawler repository](https://github.com/PeterQiu0516/WebCrawler).

### Investment Preferences Analysis - Online Survey Design
Then we designed a questionaire to investigate the customers' specific investment preferences (like risks and return rates requirements).



### Data Processing \& Analysis - Fund Filter and Classifier

In the next step, we utilized `pandas` to process the data using a fund filter together with a classifier. All kinds of statistical values of the data are also obtained in this step and get pipelined to the Model Construction part.

### Model Construction - Markowitz Mean-Variance Model and Black-litterman Model

Then we designed the specific funding recommendation system to satisfy each customer's specific investment preferences based on Python and R. 

Our project is mainly based on the Markowit mean-variance model and Black-Litterman model supported by `PyPortfolioOpt` package.

We also use a [Time Series Model - ARIMA](https://github.com/PeterQiu0516/GoogleCloud-ML-for-Trading/tree/master/Course%201%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Trading%2C%20Machine%20Learning%20%26%20GCP/Qwiklab%203%20-%20Build%20a%20Time%20Series%20Model%20(ARIMA%20Model)%20to%20Forecast%20Stock%20Price) to make better estimates of the expected return for the portfolio under the support of `statsmodels`.


### Generate Portfolio Report - Diagram Plotting
Finally, we plotted the related financial statistical charts and generate the Portfolio report by `EChart`. Sample report is also included in this repo.
